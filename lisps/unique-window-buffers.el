;; add to .emacs.el:

;;     (require 'unique-window-buffers)
;;     (setq unique-window-buffers-mode t)
;;

;;; Commentary:

;; I was annoyed that when splitting windows the same buffer shows up in the
;; new window.  It also happens when quitting help.  So I made this.
;;
;;

;; Some notes for the author:
;;
;; `split-window-*' all call `split-window'
;;
;; `bury-buffer' calls `switch-to-prev-buffer'
;;
;; `quit-window' calls `switch-to-prev-buffer', but also has a separate
;;   code-path that restores directly from window parameter `quit-restore'
;;
;; `kill-buffer' first kills the buffer, then calls
;; `replace-buffer-in-windows' to scrub the buffer from other windows.
;; `kill-buffer' has to be adviced to make the replace buffer unique.
;;
;;
;; `replace-buffer-in-windows' calls `switch-to-prev-buffer'
;;
;;
;; So advice functions `switch-to-prev-buffer' `quit-window' `split-window'
;; `kill-buffer'
